# math-tutorial

I started this because I need a place to backup these jupyter notebook tutorials.

These are tutorial materials I've been preparing for my daughter in sixth grade to help her in math competitions. First in foremost due to geometry problems she needs to learn to manipulate an simplify expressions with square roots.

I've build these notebooks using the scipy-notebook docker stack. However, the main dependency is the package sympy.

### Simplification 1
This drills simple simplification where a square root expression is reduced to a coefficient and an irreducible square root symbol

### Simplication 2
This drills the removal of simple square roots from the denominator of a fraction

### Simplification 3
This drills multiplication of simple expressions of the form $$\left(a+b\sqrt{c}\right)\left(d+f\sqrt{c}\right)
